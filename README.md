# AES-Encryption
The program is written in C++ and assumed that C++11 support is not available.

The program contains four (4) files:

- AES.h
- AES.cpp
- Support.h
- Support.cpp

AES.cpp contains the main part of the program (including the main function). The program assumes an input.txt and a key.txt file are available.

To compile and run the program type:

	g++ -o encrypt AES.cpp
	./encrypt

The file output.txt contains the result.
